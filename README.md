# babyfoot
The baby-foot application is built on nodejs. Its role is to create a team, delete a team and show how many
teams are created (teams available after creation or deletion in certain case). 
The data is shared in realtime, I've used websockets for that.

It's very dimple app, go ahead download and play it around as you wish
